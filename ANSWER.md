### What

Information regarding the schedule, capacity, and location of the 7 ferries.

### Why

We want to be able to
 - determine the current load in any vessel easily
 - determine the status of any berth (occupied/free) easily
 - prototype & simulate different schedules easily
 - Status and location of any vessel

 ### How  
  - Use a map with markers to indicate the positions of each vessel and berth
  - Use colour of the a Vessel to indicate the amount of capacity used
  - Scrollable timeline (fastforward, rewind) to explore alternate schedules
  - Berths & Vessels are hoverable, and display information indicating status

### Using The Design Methodology
 - Should have used step one more (learn!), since we don't have domain specific knowledge of ferries. Maybe we're lacking some information that would be obvious to someone with intimate knowledge of SEASPAN ferries.
 - Discover (requirements analysis) similar point #1, we began designing without very clear requirements regarding the needs of SEASPAN. It would be useful to observe employees at SEASPAN working with their current tools, and get feed back from them regarding current issues.


### Pitfalls
 - This is potentially automateable. Many industries (ie, airlines) use software to manage schedules and load. This may be a better altenative than making a visualizaton tool to aid a human to make these choices.
 - The tool described is complex, and implementing it correctly would require a serious amount of development work and user testing for it to be successful.
